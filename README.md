# Web APIs Challenge 04: Javascript Quiz

## Description

A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
Must answer the following code-related questions within the time limit. Each incorrect answer will penalize your score/time by ten seconds. Once you finished the quiz you can save your score with your initials.

Note: Coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers. In fact, employers often use them to filter out job candidates with a cut-off score. To help you prepare, weâ€™ve developed a set of technical interview questions that you can answer throughout the course. The difficulty level of these questions will increase as you become a more proficient developer.

Happy studies!
